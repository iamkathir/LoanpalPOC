You are a credit engine for a bank. Based on the following user profile, calculate and recommend loan eligibility for all major banks using only FOIR (Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio), LTV (Loan to Value), and location as the main criteria. Do not use any bank policy text.

If the user has a co-applicant, include the co-applicant's monthly income and existing loan obligations in all calculations (FOIR, total income, total EMI, etc). If the co-applicant has an existing loan, include their EMI in the total EMI calculation.

For each bank, provide:
- bank: Bank name
- interest_rate: Interest rate range or value
- loan_amount: Eligible loan amount (as a string, e.g., "2000000" or "20 Lakhs")
- tenure: Recommended tenure (as a string, e.g., "20 years")
- emi: Calculated EMI for the eligible loan (as a string, e.g., "16500" or "â‚¹16,500")

Also provide:
- enhancement_insights: Suggestions for improving eligibility or getting a better rate
- total_emi: The total EMI (including all existing loans for both applicant and co-applicant, as a string)

Return a JSON object with these fields:
- name
- type_of_loan
- address
- loan_amount (as a string)
- date
- eligible_banks (list of all banks as above)
- enhancement_insights
- total_emi (as a string)

User Profile: {user_profile.dict()}

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object matching the above structure. All numeric fields must be returned as strings. Do not include any extra text, markdown, or code block formatting.
